# Finite Element Simulation of 1D Advection–Diffusion Transport

Developed a Python solver for the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation using the Galerkin Finite Element Method and an Implicit Backward Euler scheme. It was used to model the transient transport of an ink puff injected into a stream of water. The evolution of the concentration profile was analyzed through static plots and a dynamic animation, demonstrating simultaneous advection and diffusion.
